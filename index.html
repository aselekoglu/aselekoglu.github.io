                <p>Developed a new accessory class for the Homebridge platform to control a Tuya-based pet feeder,
                    enabling seamless integration and control via Apple HomeKit. Implemented custom accessory logic
                    using
                    TypeScript, handling device commands and status updates through the Tuya API. Enhanced the existing
                    homebridge-tuya-web plugin by creating a PetFeederAccessory class, which included methods to start
                    and stop the feeder
                    and to retrieve the current feeding. Updated the configuration and index files to support the new

                <h3>Hubspot to Zoho Custom Integration | Nov 2023</h3>
                <p>Engineered a custom middleware in Google Script to transfer deal object information from Hubspot CRM
                    to Zoho CRM by using UrlFetchApp for HTTP requests, XML parsing for data extraction, and JSON
                    manipulation for processing. The project aimed to synchronize data between different CRMs used by
                    various departments, ensuring data reliability. The middleware retrieved deal object information,
                    including associated line item objects, from Hubspot, processed the data, and pushed it to Zoho as
                    account, potential, and sales order objects. Utilized: JS (Google Script), API, CRM, JSON.

                <h3>Goal Tracker Application | Dec 2022</h3>
                <p>Implemented middleware using Google Script to track sales goals. Created a custom object "Goals"
                    within the CRM and established a workflow to push created goals to Google Sheets. Utilized
                    event-driven triggers on Google Script to process each goal based on type and duration. Triggers
                    execute functions upon goal completion, querying the CRM based on goal details (team/personal goal,
                    new qualification/contracts signed, etc.) and associating the fetched objects (contacts or deals)
                    with the initial Goals object in the CRM. Calculated KPIs (e.g., total created deal amount, number
                    of contacts created) within the CRM using custom-calculated fields. <br> GitHub: <a
